### How to execute the program

In macOS:
1. Install Leap Motion SDK (macOS version), I use 2.3.1, other version should be ok.

2. Uncompress LMMeshViewer.dmg, you will see "Mesh" in folder.

3. Double click to open Mesh app.

Note: I have put libLeap dynamic library(libLeap.dylib) inside, it's fully executable without any settingï¼Œtested on other machines.
